{"name":"Pystream","tagline":"A simple streams player/manager written in PyGObject","body":"This is a indicator for the Unity desktop interface. It's meant to\r\nallow the user to keep his favourite internet streams at hand. It's\r\nwritten using the PyGObject python module and the AppIndicator API.\r\n\r\nIt allows to \r\n- start a stream clicking on one of the labels in the \"Streams\" menu\r\n- switch to a different streaming just by clicking on the\r\ncorresponding menu entry\r\n- stop the currently playing streaming.\r\n\r\nSome settings are available. They allow you to\r\n- turn on/off the notifications coming from the indicator\r\n- set the number of the streams that will be kept in the \"Recently\r\nplayed\" menu\r\n- add new streams \r\n- edit the command used to play existing streams\r\n- export the streams labels and commands to a text file\r\n- undo to changes going back to the default available streams.\r\n\r\nIn order to start the indicator execute the file\r\n'indicator-pyradio.py'.\r\n\r\nIf you want to invoke the command via the dash you can add the\r\nindicator-pyradio.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/ with\r\nthe following content:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nVersion=0.1\r\nName=indicator-pyradio\r\nComment=My favourite streaming links\r\nExec=/path/to/the/indicator/folder/indicator-pyradio.py\r\nIcon=/path/to/the/indicator/folder/icons/pyradio.svg\r\nTerminal=false\r\nType=Application\r\nCategories=Multimedia\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've only tested it on my Ubuntu install, I'm on the 13.04\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
